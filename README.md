# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running but since we're not able to get it working yet this will have to suffice.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Vanillacraft's bukkit plugins
* Version 2.0

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Please do not submit your IDE's project configuration files (eg. /idea folder however we're leaving .imls for now so that dependencies are correctly applied)
* Speaking of dependencies you so far need bukkit and craftbukkit.

### Who do I talk to? ###
